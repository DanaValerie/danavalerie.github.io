    I can read Thai provides reference material and flashcards that you can use for a few minutes every day to learn the
    Thai alphabet and vowels and master the tones. Everything you need to be able to correctly pronounce any Thai words
    you see can be learned by using this app. Simply use the app for a few minutes a day to practice and test yourself,
    and you'll be reading Thai in no time. You can even pick from a large selection of common fonts to help with
    recognition of real Thai writing in the real world.
